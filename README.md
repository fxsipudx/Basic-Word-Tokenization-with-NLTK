# Basic Word Tokenization with NLTK

This project provides a Jupyter notebook for performing basic word tokenization using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python. Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into individual words or tokens, which is a fundamental step in text preprocessing for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Features

- **Word Tokenization**: Splits input text into individual words or tokens.
- **Sentence Tokenization**: Optionally divides text into sentences before word tokenization.
- **Stop Words Filtering**: Filters out common stop words to focus on meaningful words.
- **Punctuation Removal**: Cleans up tokens by removing punctuation marks.
- **Visual Analysis**: Provides basic visualization for token frequency.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need the following Python packages:

- `nltk`
- `matplotlib` (for visualizations)

You can install these packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install nltk matplotlib
